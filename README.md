# Stereo Depth 
## Introduction
The brain is a fantastic super computer with unmatched 3D object recognition and depth estimation. The entire ocular system combined with over 20 color channels funneled into the great processing power of our visual cortex result in our capability to see. Stereo depth is a major part of this machinery and  in this paper we delve into the topic by investigating existing computer algorithms. Depth extraction from stereo estimation boils down to Triangulation. The papers seeks to explain three primary approaches and details surrounding stereo depth extraction. i

## Background
Computer vision has seen explosive growth during the turn of the century; stereo depth in particular has seen its fair share of research due to its application in  panaroma Mosaic [Human FOV = 200 x 135°], better face tracking, facial recognition, autonomous driving, high resolution geometric sampling and many others. The result of this high interest is a plethora of algorithms and papers describing various ways of estimating depth from two images. 
nto the the various e primary reason f extracting from stereo images takes advantage of triangulation re are three primary approaches to determining depth from stereo images, local optimia and the paper discuss these approaches and selects 3 algorithms to  differences of algorithms local optimization, global optimizaiont and 

Depth Estimation is inherently an optimization problem there are three primary methods
- Local optimization
- Global optimization
-- Markov random trees
-- Energy minimization - State of the art
--- simulated annealing
--- graph cuts
## Methods
Built one example of block based 
- Cuda cores, and performance ….
- Bad data set ? -> if you replace some pixels
- Dimmer or low photon conditions
Imported a copy of implementation
	Bad data set? Smoothing reqiurement

## Results
The world of graph cuts are dominating the field
The visual cues x,y an z are not able to be used in the algorithms
Future 
## Conclusions

The goal is to identify your algorithms [3].  
Understanding, explaining, and contrasting the algorithms would be a good project. 
The evaluation of the algorithms is good, but more it is more important to focus on understanding how they work and the differences between the algorithms.
